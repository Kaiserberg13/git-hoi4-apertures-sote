Initially, the corporation used the power of angels to heal the wounded, which brought it recognition and respect worldwide. As its popularity and influence grew, §ZCAMELIA§! began to expand its activities, encompassing new spheres and markets. §ZOMEN§! had a son named §ZMAKOTO§!.

It was led by the §ZSCHUBERT§! family. However, after leaving §ZINTERCOM§!, the question of future management arose, as the §ZSCHUBERT§! family moved to work at §ZCAMELIA SYNESIS CORPORATION§!.\n\nAt this critical juncture, §ZHEINRICH WEILSTAIR§! took over the leadership. Under his guidance, the corporation was renamed §ZARSTOTZKA§! and continued its rapid development.

Previously, §ZROTATOSK§! consisted of two different, quite ancient corporations. After the Third World War, African countries recovered from the nuclear winter faster than anyone else, beginning to build civilization from scratch while trading with the local ruined cities of the remaining European countries.\n\nAt that time, a "hot war" was ongoing (analogous to the Cold War but with more military conflicts), which allowed the previously unknown company §ZTOSKA§!, named after its founder's surname, to amass significant wealth by selling weapons. After the revival of European countries, §ZTOSKA§! expanded as a corporation, taking an honorable first place. However, with the emergence of §ZINTERHOLM§! and the advent of peacetime, §ZTOSKA§! began to lose its influence, entering into a power struggle with §ZINTERHOLM§!.\n\nIn response, §ZTOSKA§! merged with one of the powerful corporations — §ZROTOR MOTORS§!. By combining their names, they formed §ZROTATOSK§!. Ultimately, the corporation belonged to two families, but an agreement was reached whereby the face of the corporation would be just one person. At that time, it was §ZMICHAEL WILSBERG§!, but for unknown reasons, the Supreme Court removed him from his position, transferring leadership to the §ZDELMAS§! family.

The entire media industry is subordinate to and depends on this corporation.\n\nRecently, on September 4, 2966, its owner §ZAAREN COX§! passed away, and currently, the corporation is in the hands of his chosen successor, whom he appointed shortly before his death.

These activities earned him a fortune, which he used to build a media empire by inviting bloggers and content creators to collaborate under his brand. \n\nOver time, the corporation solidified its reputation and became a benchmark for quality in the production of anime, series, and other media products.

Because of this, they are fierce competitors with §ZZAPHKIEL ENTERPRISES§!. Previously, §ZMORGAN KLEIN§! was an ordinary employee working in Canada, but fate led him to the USA to start anew. There, he met §ZAAREN COX§!, with whom he became involved in questionable activities within the nightclub and entertainment industry.\n\nHowever, when his best friend and colleague §ZAAREN COX§! founded §ZZAPHKIEL ENTERPRISES§!, naming it after his right-hand man—a friend who gave his life for their shared ideals—§ZMORGAN KLEIN§! began to doubt the goals that §ZAAREN COX§! was promoting to his employees. He disliked that his colleague was starting to take everything into his own hands, distancing him from decision-making and power. As a result, he gathered people from the corporation who were dissatisfied with §ZAAREN COX§!'s policies and created his own company, naming it §ZEQUONICS INCORPORATED§!.\n\nBoth corporations entered into a fierce battle for influence in the industry. They fight for every company, every blogger, and actor, striving to attract the best talents and resources under their banners. The rivalry between §ZEQUONICS INCORPORATED§! and §ZZAPHKIEL ENTERPRISES§! has become legendary, pushing them to constantly improve and innovate to outdo each other.
